This hint aims at explainning my "Double Simulator".
This programme can simulate "Double operations" with IEEE 754 standard.
There are two source code.
One of them can finish the homework (the normal one xD).
Just run the executable file compiled from it.
Input 1 to summon 20000 groups of numbers and operators randomly.
10000 of them are actually randomly summoned.
Other 10000 of them are combined to cater to the addition and subtraction operation.
The result is written to the file "Result.out".
(INF and NaN included but 10000 groups ... I can work more but slowly.)
Input 2 to finish the formula you typed from the standard input.
The format of the formula is "number1 operator number2 '='"
For example: 1e100 * 1.5e210 = (enter)
(64-bits input not supported)
both of the output of the two operations are:
simulated result in scientific representation  simulated result with 25 numbers after the dot
real      result in scientific representation  real      result with 25 numbers after the dot

The "crazy-test version" can summon double numbers in bits independently.
It compared the simulator's answer with the system's answer unstoppably unless you kill it.


have fun.
