This hint aims at explainning my "Double Simulator".
Just run the EXCUTABLE FILE compiled from the source code.
Input 1 to summon 20000 groups of numbers and operators randomly.
10000 of them are actually randomly summoned.
Other 10000 of them are combined to cater to the addition and subtraction operation.
The result is outputed into the file "Result.out".
(INF and NaN included but 10000 groups ... I can work more but slowly.)
Input 2 to finish the formula you typed from the standard input.
The format of the formula is "number1 operator number2 '='"
For example: 1e100 * 1.5e210 = (enter)

both of the output of the two operations are:
simulated result in scientific representation  simulated result with 25 numbers after the dot
real      result in scientific representation  real      result with 25 numbers after the dot

have fun.
