This double calculator can finish some ... double calculation (ZX's order worked well)
In theory ... I do consider some complex situations.
But I haven't tested or debugged them yet LOL~~~ (one of the senior fellow apprentices told us that's unnecessary LOL)
I know some formular like ... 1.0/+.23e-8 ... or something like this may make mistakes.

Explanation:
formular_summon.c : generate some formular in ZX's order and generate a compilable file with name "checker.c"
Double_Calculator.c : finish the formulars in "Double_Calculator.in"
checker.c : output the correct number calculated by system double
summon.h : a head file with some data generator

You just need to:
compile "formular_summon.c"
run the executable file
compile "Double_Calculator.c"
run the executable file
compile "checker.c"
run the executable file
compare the two ".out" file to ensure if they are absolutely the same.

If you want to type in some your own formulars.
You need to edit the files : "Double_Calculator.in" "checker.c".

Have fun~
